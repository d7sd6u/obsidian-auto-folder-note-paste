- [reveal-folded](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-reveal-folded) - reveal current file in file explorer while collapsing everything else
- [hide-index-files](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-hide-index-files) - hide folder notes (index files) from file explorer
- [crosslink-advanced](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-crosslink-advanced) - adds commands to deal with [ftags]([folder note](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-lazy-cached-vault-load?tab=readme-ov-file#wait-a-minute-what-are-folderindex-notes-what-are-ftags-what-do-you-mean-annexed))-oriented vaults: add ftags, create child note, open random unftagged file, etc.
- [virtual-dirs](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-virtual-dirs) - adds "virtual" folder files / folder indexes. You can open them, you can search for them, but they do not take space and "materialise" whenever you want a _real_ folder note
- [viewer-ftags](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-viewer-ftags) - add ftags as chips on top of markdown/file editors/previews. And children as differently styled chips too!
- [git-annex-autofetch](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-git-annex-autofetch) - lets you open annexed but not present files as if they were right on your device (basically, NFS/overlay-fs hybrid in your Obsidian)
